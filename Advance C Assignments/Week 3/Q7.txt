Q. What is the difference between exec and fork?

	Ans.
	
	"fork()" is used to create a new process, known as the child process, which is an exact copy of the calling process, known as the 	parent process.

	"exec()" is used to replace the current process's memory space with a new program.It loads a new program into the current 	process's memory and starts executing it from the beginning simply it is used to execute new programs within existing processes. 

	Unlike fork(), exec() does not create a new process; it replaces the existing process with a new one.
